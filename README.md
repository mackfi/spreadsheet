# Spreadsheet

As this is an academic project for a required CS course at the University of Utah, I do not feel comfortable sharing the code in its entirety.

This project is a .NET MAUI spreadsheet application allowing users to view/edit a spreadsheet, save and restore data to a spreadsheet file, and evaluate formulas. Additionally, multiple UI themes are available, and a help/information section is included as well.
